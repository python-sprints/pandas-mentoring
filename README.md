# Funding ideas

A list of funding opportunities. Most of them depend on the pandas maintainers
to apply to the program, before people can apply for the scholarships, but
probably worth to keep a list somewhere:

- [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/): students only, once per year, amount depending on location $3,000 to $6,600 + $500 for the project
- [Google season of docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/): same as GSoC
- [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/): $5,500 + $500 for conference attendee, twice per year
- Corporate sponsors: companies hiring an intern directly to work in an open source project (not very common afaik)
- [NumFOCUS small development grants](https://numfocus.org/blog/numfocus-awards-development-grants-to-open-source-projects-spring-2018): 3 times per year, max $5,000 per grant
- pandas funding: very limited until now, just small donations through NumFOCUS that so far just covered travelling expenses of maintainers attending the anual sprint. The funding could increase, mainly because of Tidelift, the CZI grants, and a new website redesign with a more visible donations page.
