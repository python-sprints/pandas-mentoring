These are some of the things I have learnt while creating pull requests:

Merge conflicts isn't as difficult as it sounds, conflict markers and diff are your friends to help recognize where
the conflict(s) is/are and fix them.
Keep asking questions,reading others' feedbacks till you figure out what to do.

Please add what you have learnt above this line without empty lines. Thank you
